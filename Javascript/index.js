/*
Logical Operators
Logical Operators : Boolean ( True / False)

- And (&&) : Checks for both conditions to be true, e.g (a>5 && a<10);
- OR (||) : Checks for at least one conditions to be true e.g (a>5 || a >10)
- NOT (!) : Returns false if the result is true e.g !( a>5 )

** Operators are used to control the flow of a program that meets certain criteria.
